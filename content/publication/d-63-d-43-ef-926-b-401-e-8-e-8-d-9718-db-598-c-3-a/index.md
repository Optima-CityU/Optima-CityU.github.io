abstract: Tchebycheff decomposition represents one of the most widely used decomposition
  approaches that can convert a multiobjective optimization problem into a set of
  scalar optimization subproblems. Nevertheless, the geometric properties of the subproblem
  objective functions in Tchebycheff decomposition have not been explicitly studied.
  This paper proposes a Tchebycheff decomposition with lp -norm constraint on direction
  vectors in which the subproblem objective functions are endowed with clear geometric
  property. Especially, the Tchebycheff decomposition with l2 -norm constraint on
  direction vectors is taken as an example to illustrate its advantage. A new unary
  R2 indicator is also introduced to approximate the hyper-volume metric and justify
  the efficiency of the proposed Tchebycheff decomposition. A resultant Tchebycheff
  decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) with l2-norm constraint
  and a new population update strategy is proposed to solve multiobjective optimization
  problems. The experimental results on both benchmark and real-world multiobjective
  optimization problems show that the proposed algorithm is capable of obtaining high
  quality solutions compared with other state-of-the-art MOEAs.
