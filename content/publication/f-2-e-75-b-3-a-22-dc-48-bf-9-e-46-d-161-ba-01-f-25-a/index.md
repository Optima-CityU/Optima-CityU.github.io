abstract: In the field of preference-based evolutionary multiobjective optimization,
  optimization algorithms are required to search for the Pareto optimal solutions
  preferred by the decision maker (DM). The reference point is a type of techniques
  that effectively describe the preferences of DM. So far, the reference point is
  either static or interactive with the evolutionary process. However, the existing
  reference point techniques do not cover all application scenarios. A novel case,
  i.e., the reference point changes over time due to the environment change, has not
  been considered. This paper focuses on the multiobjective optimization problems
  with dynamic preferences of the DM. First, we propose a change model of the reference
  point to simulate the change of the preference by the DM over time. Then, a dynamic
  preference-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm framework with a clonal selection
  algorithm (ĝa-NSCSA) and a genetic algorithm (ĝa-NSGA-II) is designed to solve such
  kind of optimization problems. In addition, in terms of practical applications,
  the experiments on the portfolio optimization problems with the dynamic reference
  point model are tested. Experimental results on the benchmark problems and the practical
  applications show that ĝa-NSCSA exhibits better performance among the compared optimization
  algorithms. © The Author(s) 2022
