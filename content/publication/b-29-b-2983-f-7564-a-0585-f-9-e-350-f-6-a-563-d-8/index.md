abstract: In multiobjective optimization, the R2 indicator is widely used for designing
  indicator-based algorithms, and the Tchebycheff approach is commonly employed in
  decomposition-based algorithms. Despite their wide use, the connection between these
  two different paradigms is still not well understood, particularly in the field
  of multiobjective efficient global optimization (MOEGO). Considering that expected
  improvement (EI) is a cornerstone in efficient global optimization, this paper first
  studies the relationship between R2-based EI and Tchebycheff-based EI. Then, we
  introduce a Many-to-Few (M2F) decomposition framework, offering a new perspective
  for linking the R2-based method and the Tchebycheff decomposition approach. By incorporating
  M2F decomposition into MOEGO, a new algorithm called R2/D-EGO is proposed. At each
  iteration, R2/D-EGO utilizes the Tchebycheff decomposition paradigm to generate
  a set of candidate solutions, each one corresponding to a different weight vector.
  Subsequently, a subset of query points is selected from the candidates based on
  the lower bound of R2-based EI. Empirical results indicate that the proposed R2/D-EGO
  is highly competitive in comparison with both R2-based and decomposition-based MOEGO
  algorithms in the parallel (or batch) setting. Â© 2024 IEEE.
