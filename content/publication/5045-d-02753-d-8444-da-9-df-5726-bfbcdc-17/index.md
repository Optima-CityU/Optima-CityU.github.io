abstract: Complicated geometric shapes of Pareto fronts can cause difficulties for
  multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. To deal with these difficulties, efficient
  diversity strategies must be highly addressed in order to obtain a set of representative
  Pareto solutions. In decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms,
  this is often done by optimizing multiple single objective subproblems defined by
  a set of weight vectors. For complicated Pareto fronts with extreme convexity, disconnection
  or degeneracy, however, it is nontrivial to set these weight vector properly. To
  overcome this shortcoming, we propose a new decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary
  algorithm based on a hybrid weighting strategy, which optimizes both random subproblems
  and fixed subproblems. To maintain diversity of nondominated solutions stored in
  external population, a new archiving strategy based on adaptive Epsilon dominance
  is also suggested in our proposed algorithm. Our experimental results have showed
  that our proposed algorithm is superior to several other state-of-the-art multiobjective
  evolutionary algorithms on a set of benchmark multiobjective test problems with
  different challenging difficulties regarding the geometric shapes of Pareto fronts.
