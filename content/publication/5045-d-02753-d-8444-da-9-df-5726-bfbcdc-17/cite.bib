 abstract = {Complicated geometric shapes of Pareto fronts can cause difficulties for multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. To deal with these difficulties, efficient diversity strategies must be highly addressed in order to obtain a set of representative Pareto solutions. In decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, this is often done by optimizing multiple single objective subproblems defined by a set of weight vectors. For complicated Pareto fronts with extreme convexity, disconnection or degeneracy, however, it is nontrivial to set these weight vector properly. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a new decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on a hybrid weighting strategy, which optimizes both random subproblems and fixed subproblems. To maintain diversity of nondominated solutions stored in external population, a new archiving strategy based on adaptive Epsilon dominance is also suggested in our proposed algorithm. Our experimental results have showed that our proposed algorithm is superior to several other state-of-the-art multiobjective evolutionary algorithms on a set of benchmark multiobjective test problems with different challenging difficulties regarding the geometric shapes of Pareto fronts.},
