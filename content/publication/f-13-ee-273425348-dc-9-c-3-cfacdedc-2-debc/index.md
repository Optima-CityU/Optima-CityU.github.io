abstract: Hypervolume subset selection (HSS) plays an important role in various aspects
  of the field of evolutionary multi-objective optimization, such as environmental
  selection and post-processing for decision-making. The goal of these problems is
  to find the optimal subset that maximizes the hypervolume from a given candidate
  solution set. Many methods have been developed to solve or approximately solve different
  types of HSS problems. However, existing approaches cannot effectively solve HSS
  problems with a large number of objectives within a short computation time. This
  drawback directly limits their applicability as a component for developing new EMO
  algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-to-rank based framework,
  named LTR-HSS, for solving the challenging HSS problems with a large number of objectives.
  The experimental results show that, compared to other state-of-the-art HSS methods,
  our proposed LTR-HSS requires a shorter computation time to solve HSS problems with
  large numbers of objectives while achieving superior or competitive hypervolume
  performance. This demonstrates the potential of our method to be integrated into
  algorithms for many-objective optimization.
