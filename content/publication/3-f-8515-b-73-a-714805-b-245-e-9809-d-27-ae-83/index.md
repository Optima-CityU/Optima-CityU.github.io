abstract: High quality product quality prediction is very important for iron and steel
  enterprises to ensure stable production. However, most existing prediction methods
  are manually designed learning models. These methods consider only macroscopic data
  while ignoring mesoscopic data that also have a significant impact on product quality.
  Thus, they are often poor at accuracy and generalization performance in practice.
  To address this issue, a multi-objective convolutional neural networks ensemble
  learning method with multi-scale data fusion (MOCNNEL-MSDF) is developed. Using
  data fusion of macro/meso data derived from kinetic models, MOCNNEL-MSDF first evolves
  a swarm of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by knowledge-transferring based
  reproduction and adaptive weights initialization adjustment to improve learning
  performance, and then a sparse ensemble approach based on differential evolution
  is applied to achieve the final prediction model from the evolved CNNs. Experimental
  results on both benchmark data and practical data of continuous annealing show that
  MOCNNEL-MSDF achieves competitive or better accuracy and robustness compared with
  other powerful learning methods, and outperforms the existing strip quality prediction
  models. The proposed method can be used in the product quality modeling of each
  process in the iron and steel industry, where it is desirable to combine mechanism
  models with production process data to construct a product quality prediction model
  with higher accuracy and generalization. Â© 2023 IEEE
