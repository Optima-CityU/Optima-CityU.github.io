abstract: Multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) decomposes
  a multiobjective optimization problem into a set of scalar optimization subproblems
  and optimizes them in a collaborative manner. Subproblems and solutions are two
  sets of agents that naturally exist in MOEA/D. The selection of promising solutions
  for subproblems can be regarded as a matching between subproblems and solutions.
  Stable matching, proposed in economics, can effectively resolve conflicts of interests
  among selfish agents in the market. In this paper, we advocate the use of a simple
  and effective stable matching (STM) model to coordinate the selection process in
  MOEA/D. In this model, subproblem agents can express their preferences over the
  solution agents, and vice versa. The stable outcome produced by the STM model matches
  each subproblem with one single solution, and it tradeoffs convergence and diversity
  of the evolutionary search. Comprehensive experiments have shown the effectiveness
  and competitiveness of our MOEA/D algorithm with the STM model. We have also demonstrated
  that user-preference information can be readily used in our proposed algorithm to
  find a region that decision makers are interested in.
