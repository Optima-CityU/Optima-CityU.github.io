abstract: A key issue in evolutionary algorithms for dynamic multi-objective optimization
  problems (DMOPs) is how to detect and response environmental changes. Most existing
  evolutionary algorithms use a single strategy for this purpose. However, single
  strategy is not always effective. In this paper, we propose a multi-strategy dynamic
  multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with hybrid change response (MDMEA-HCR) to
  solve DMOPs. Our proposed algorithm not only provides a new way for handling dynamics
  in DMOPs, but also introduce a static multi-objective optimizer based on a multi-strategy
  evolutionary operator. More specifically, we propose a hybrid environmental change
  response mechanism to integrate several strategies for prediction and response adjustments.
  When the environment changes, the hybrid environmental change response strategy
  makes an initial response to the change, and then the response adjustment mechanism
  improves the quality of the response population and adjusts its optimization direction
  to achieve fast tracking of Pareto optimal sets and Pareto optimal fronts in the
  new environment. During the static optimal optimization phase, a variable neighbor-based
  multi-strategy evolutionary operator is used to generate new solutions, it is very
  helpful for both convergence and diversity preservation. MDMEA-HCR has been compared
  with some other advanced DMOEAs on 31 test instances. Experimental results show
  that MDMEA-HCR performs better than others on most instances. Â© 2023 Elsevier B.V.
