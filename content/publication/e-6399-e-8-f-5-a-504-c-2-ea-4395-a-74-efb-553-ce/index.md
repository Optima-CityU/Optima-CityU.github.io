abstract: Feature extraction is a critical issue in many machine learning systems.
  A number of basic fusion operators have been proposed and studied. This paper proposes
  an evolutionary algorithm, called evolutionary deep fusion method, for searching
  an optimal combination scheme of different basic fusion operators to fuse multi-view
  features. We apply our proposed method to chemical structure recognition. Our proposed
  method can directly take images as inputs, and users do not need to transform images
  to other formats. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method
  can achieve a better performance than those designed by human experts on this real-life
  problem.
