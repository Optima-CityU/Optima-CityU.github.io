abstract: The multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) under uncertain environments
  are very challenging to be solved due to the sensitivities of some robust decision
  variables. To find the robust Pareto fronts (PFs) of these MOPs, the mean effective
  objective function (MEOF) is often used for evaluating the qualities of solutions
  in the existing evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithms. In the
  MEOF evaluation, the objective function values of multiple solutions in the neighborhood
  of a certain solution should be averaged. As a result, the MEOF-based EMO algorithms
  consume a large number of function evaluations to find robust PFs with high qualities.
  To overcome this weakness, we propose a new MEOF-based EMO framework with two-level
  surrogate models, denoted by EMO-MEOF/TS, which utilizes radial basis function and
  Gaussian process model to predict high-quality robust solutions at the levels of
  global search and local search. Some experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance
  of the proposed framework on some modified MOPs with robust decision variables.
  Our experimental results demonstrate that EMO-MEOF/TS is advantageous against several
  robust MOEAs in approximating the PFs of MOPs with robust characteristics. Â© 2023
