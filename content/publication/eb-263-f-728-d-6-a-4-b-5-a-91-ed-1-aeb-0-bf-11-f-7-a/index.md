abstract: In some industrial applications, it is required to do off-line multiobjective
  optimization in embedded systems. Due to their limited computing and memory capability,
  embedded processor may not be able to run conventional multiobjective optimization
  evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). This article proposes a micro MOEA with piecewise
  strategy (μMOEA) for industrial optimization in embedded processor. μMOEA introduces
  an improved piecewise strategy based on the MOEA/D framework, which serially optimizes
  subclusters to be compatible with embedded processor under limited computing power.
  For the purpose of further enhancing μMOEA, a dynamic and flexible weight vector
  update trigger mechanism is proposed, so that the algorithm can save and utilize
  the computing resources of the embedded processor as much as possible. Abundant
  artificial test problems are carrying out to test the performance of μMOEA. Through
  various experiments, it can be found that μMOEA has outstanding performance in ZDT,
  DTLZ, SMOP, and MaF problems. Last and most importantly, μMOEA is successfully applied
  to two specific application scenarios of industrial optimization on embedded processor
  for simulation, such as two different types of semi-autogenous grinding optimization
  problems and microgrid energy optimization problem, which prove the feasibility
  of applying MOEA to embedded processor. © 2023 IEEE.
