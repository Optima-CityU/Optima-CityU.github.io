abstract: Pareto dominance-based multiobjective optimization has been successfully
  applied to constrained evolutionary optimization during the last two decades. However,
  as another famous multiobjective optimization framework, decomposition-based multiobjective
  optimization has not received sufficient attention from constrained evolutionary
  optimization. In this paper, we make use of decomposition-based multiobjective optimization
  to solve constrained optimization problems (COPs). In our method, first of all,
  a COP is transformed into a biobjective optimization problem (BOP). Afterward, the
  transformed BOP is decomposed into a number of scalar optimization subproblems.
  After generating an offspring for each subproblem by differential evolution, the
  weighted sum method is utilized for selection. In addition, to make decomposition-based
  multiobjective optimization suit the characteristics of constrained evolutionary
  optimization, weight vectors are elaborately adjusted. Moreover, for some extremely
  complicated COPs, a restart strategy is introduced to help the population jump out
  of a local optimum in the infeasible region. Extensive experiments on three sets
  of benchmark test functions, namely, 24 test functions from IEEE CEC2006, 36 test
  functions from IEEE CEC2010, and 56 test functions from IEEE CEC2017, have demonstrated
  that the proposed method shows better or at least competitive performance against
  other state-of-the-art methods.
