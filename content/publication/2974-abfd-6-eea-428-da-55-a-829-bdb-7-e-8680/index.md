abstract: In many real-world engineering design optimization problems, objective function
  evaluations are very time costly and often conducted by solving partial differential
  equations. Gradients of the objective functions can be obtained as a byproduct.
  Naturally, these problems can be solved more efficiently if gradient information
  is used. This paper studies how to do expensive multiobjective optimization when
  gradients are available. We propose a method, called MOEA/Dâ€“GEK, which combines
  MOEA/D and gradient-enhanced kriging. The gradients are used for building kriging
  models. Experimental studies on a set of test instances and an engineering problem
  of aerodynamic design optimization for a transonic airfoil show the high efficiency
  and effectiveness of our proposed method.
