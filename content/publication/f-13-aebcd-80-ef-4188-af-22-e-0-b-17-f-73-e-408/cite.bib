 abstract = {The hypervolume and hypervolume contributions are widely used in multiobjective evolutionary optimization. However, their exact calculation is NP-hard. By definition, hypervolume is an m-D integral (where m is the number of objectives). Using polar coordinate, this paper transforms the hypervolume into an (m-1)-D integral, and then proposes two approximation methods for computing the hypervolume and hypervolume contributions. Numerical experiments have been conducted to investigate the performance of our proposed methods.},
