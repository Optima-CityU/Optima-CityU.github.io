abstract: The hypervolume and hypervolume contributions are widely used in multiobjective
  evolutionary optimization. However, their exact calculation is NP-hard. By definition,
  hypervolume is an m-D integral (where m is the number of objectives). Using polar
  coordinate, this paper transforms the hypervolume into an (m-1)-D integral, and
  then proposes two approximation methods for computing the hypervolume and hypervolume
  contributions. Numerical experiments have been conducted to investigate the performance
  of our proposed methods.
