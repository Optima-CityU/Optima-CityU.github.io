abstract: In practice, the multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) is typically
  challenging in two aspects. On the one hand, its Pareto front has imbalanced search
  difficulties; on the other hand, its search space contains many dominance resistant
  solutions (DRSs). Decomposing a complicated MOP into several simple MOPs for collaborative
  optimization (M2M) has been acknowledged to be efficient in coping with the imbalanced
  search difficulty. Nevertheless, the convergence efficiency of the M2M-based multi-objective
  evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is rarely investigated, especially on the MOP with
  DRSs. This paper reveals two convergence challenges faced by M2M-based MOEAs. Subsequently,
  a variant called MOEA/D-OMDEA is proposed to achieve better convergence efficiency
  without sacrificing advantages in diversity preservation. MOEA/D-OMDEA integrates
  a new relaxed dominance criterion, namely the OM-dominance criterion, into its environmental
  selection to alleviate the negative influence of inferior solutions (e.g., DRSs)
  as well as to better balance convergence and diversity. MOEA/D-OMDEA is compared
  with ten state-of-the-art MOEAs on two sets of MOP benchmarks with different characteristics
  and a real-world problem. Experimental results indicate that MOEA/D-OMDEA can significantly
  outperform the other ten competitors on these problems. In addition, this paper
  provides a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of each new algorithmic component
  and the sensitivity of each newly-introduced parameter. Â© 2023 Published by Elsevier
