abstract: This paper proposes an effective ensemble framework for tackling multi-objective
  optimization problems, by combining the advantages of various evolutionary operators
  and selection criteria that are run on multiple populations. A simple ensemble algorithm
  is realized as a prototype to demonstrate our proposed framework. Two mechanisms,
  namely competition and cooperation, are employed to drive the running of the ensembles.
  Competition is designed by adaptively running different evolutionary operators on
  multiple populations. The operator that better fits the problemtextquoterights characteristics
  will receive more computational resources, being rewarded by a decomposition-based
  credit assignment strategy. Cooperation is achieved by a cooperative selection of
  the offspring generated by different populations. In this way, the promising offspring
  from one population have chances to migrate into the other populations to enhance
  their convergence or diversity. Moreover, the population update information is further
  exploited to build an evolutionary potentiality model, which is used to guide the
  evolutionary process. Our experimental results show the superior performance of
  our proposed ensemble algorithms in solving most cases of a set of thirty-one test
  problems, which corroborates the advantages of our ensemble framework.
