abstract: Many combinatorial multiobjective optimization problems involve very costly-to-evaluate
  objectives and constraints. It is very difficult, if not impossible, for traditional
  heuristics to solve these problems with an acceptable amount of computational time.
  In this paper, we show that offline machine learning can be very useful to assist
  multiobjective evolutionary algorithms to tackle this kind of problem. We take a
  complicated real-life multiobjective routing-packing problem as the test bed. We
  propose to use offline machine learning methods to replace time-consuming packing
  heuristics for packing feasibility prediction. Experiments show that the machine
  learning models can be 1,000 times faster than some commonly used packing heuristics
  and their accuracy can be as high as 98%. We adopt MOEA/D to decompose the problem
  into a number of single objective subproblems and solve them in a collaborative
  manner. We propose an encoding strategy to represent each routing scheme and use
  genetic operators to generate new routes. Experimental studies have been conducted
  on 100 instances from HUAWEItextquoterights real-world logistics application and
  two test suites from the literature. Our proposed method can solve each HUAWEI instance
  in around one minute. Our solutions on the two test suites are comparable to other
  existing algorithms, and the overall computational cost of our method is significantly
  lower than others. Â© 2024 IEEE.
