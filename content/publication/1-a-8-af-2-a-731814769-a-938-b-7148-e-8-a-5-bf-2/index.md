abstract: An objective normalization strategy is essential in any evolutionary multi-
  or manyobjective optimization (EMO or EMaO) algorithm, due to the distance calculations
  between objective vectors required to compute diversity and convergence of population
  members. For the decomposition based EMO/EMaO algorithms involving the Penalty Boundary
  Intersection (PBI) metric, normalization is an important matter due to the computation
  of two distance metrics. In this paper, we make a theoretical analysis of the effect
  of instabilities in the normalization process on the performance of PBIbased MOEA/D
  and a proposed PBI-based NSGA-III procedure. Although the effect is well recognized
  in the literature, few theoretical studies have been done so far to understand its
  true nature and the choice of a suitable penalty parameter value for an arbitrary
  problem. The developed theoretical results have been corroborated with extensive
  experimental results on three to 15-objective convex and non-convex instances of
  DTLZ and WFG problems. The paper makes important theoretical conclusions on PBI-based
  decomposition algorithms derived from the study.
