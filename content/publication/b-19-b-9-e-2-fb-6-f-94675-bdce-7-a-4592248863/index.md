abstract: An ensemble-learning-based multiobjective optimization is proposed for antenna
  design. By integrating the local search into multiobjective evolutionary algorithm
  based on decomposition (MOEA/D) and selecting appropriate solutions of the local
  search acquired with different offspring reproduction (OR) operators, the MOEA/D
  combined with ensemble OR (MOEA/D-EOR) is presented. Parallel local OR operators
  based on samples are also merged, for the first time, by exhaustively mining the
  evolution data of the optimization searching. The diversity and convergence of MOEA/D-EOR
  are verified by several widely used benchmark problems. The efficiency of MOEA/D-EOR
  is demonstrated by designing a high-performance bow-tie multiple-input and multiple-output
  (MIMO) antenna, which saves at least 25% of the optimization time. The overall performance
  of MOEA/D-EOR is further demonstrated by designing a 2 × 2 MIMO patch antenna in
  a compact size of 0.667λ0 × 0.667λ0, which achieves a high isolation of 24 dB in
  an operation band of 4.95 to 5.07 GHz.
