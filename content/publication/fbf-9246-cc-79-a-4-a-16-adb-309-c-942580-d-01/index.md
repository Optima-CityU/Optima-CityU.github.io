abstract: Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) provide an efficient framework to describe
  the causal relations in actual applications, and it appears more and more important
  to learn a DAG from training data in causal discovery. Recently, a novel methodology,
  which projects the acyclic constraints by an algebraic characterization and employs
  continuous optimization to carry the causal discovery, gradually became the mainstream.
  However, such methods focus on a best-fitting to the training data and cannot utilize
  the prior knowledge in an efficient way. To resolve this problem, we suggest incorporating
  structural constraints into continuous optimization. For edge constraints, we regard
  the activation value of the difference between the constraint matrix after thresholding
  and the weight matrix as the optimization goal. For path constraints, we use the
  deviation concluded from the power matrix on kth path graphs to design the penalty
  functions. For ordering constraints, we exploit the representation based on the
  negative edge/path constraints. The mathematical derivations prove that equality
  constraint program (ECP), in which proposed equality constraints powerfully embody
  the required structural restrictions, are solvable. Furthermore, the experimental
  evaluations indicate that the proposed method develops higher scalability and accuracy
  against state-of-the-art algorithms. Â© 2024 Elsevier B.V.
