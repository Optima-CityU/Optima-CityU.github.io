abstract: Deploying in-building distributed antenna systems (IB-DAS) is a crucial
  step towards providing ubiquitous wireless services. In this paper, we study the
  multiobjective network planning problem, aiming to minimize both construction costs
  and average power loss. The main challenge in solving this problem is efficiently
  representing the network structure. To address this, we encode the network structure
  as a spanning tree, with the root node connecting to the signal source, and leaf
  and non-leaf nodes representing all floors and power devices, respectively. Compared
  to existing encodings, this tree encoding offers several advantages, including improved
  locality and the ability to easily generate valid solutions. Additionally, we propose
  a tree-encoded evolutionary algorithm called TMOEA. Since the standard operators
  cannot be applied, we devise problem-specific crossover and mutation operators to
  produce tree-encoded solutions. Moreover, the Tchebycheff approach is employed to
  update solutions. Comprehensive experiments on 11 test instances with up to 30 floors
  demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms four compared algorithms in
  terms of both the hypervolume indicator and the inverted generational distance indicator
  for each test instance. Â© 2013 IEEE.
