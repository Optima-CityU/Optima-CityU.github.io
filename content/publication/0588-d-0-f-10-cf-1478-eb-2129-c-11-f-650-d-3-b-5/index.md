abstract: This paper introduces a special multitasking optimization problem called
  the competitive multitasking optimization problem (CMTOP). Its distinctive characteristics
  are that all taskstextquoteright objectives are comparable, and its optimal solution
  is the best one among the optimal solutions of all the individual problems. This
  paper proposes an evolutionary algorithm with an online resource allocation strategy
  and an adaptive information transfer mechanism to solve the CMTOP. The experimental
  results on benchmark and real-world problems show that our proposed algorithm is
  effective and efficient.
