abstract: Neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) is a promising learning-based approach
  for solving challenging combinatorial optimization problems without specialized
  algorithm design by experts. However, most constructive NCO methods cannot solve
  problems with large-scale instance sizes, which significantly diminishes their usefulness
  for real-world applications. In this work, we propose a novel Light Encoder and
  Heavy Decoder (LEHD) model with a strong generalization ability to address this
  critical issue. The LEHD model can learn to dynamically capture the relationships
  between all available nodes of varying sizes, which is beneficial for model generalization
  to problems of various scales. Moreover, we develop a data-efficient training scheme
  and a flexible solution construction mechanism for the proposed LEHD model. By training
  on small-scale problem instances, the LEHD model can generate nearly optimal solutions
  for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem
  (CVRP) with up to 1000 nodes, and also generalizes well to solve real-world TSPLib
  and CVRPLib problems. These results confirm our proposed LEHD model can significantly
  improve the state-of-the-art performance for constructive NCO. The code is available
  at https://github.com/CIAM-Group/NCO_code/tree/main/single_objective/LEHD. Â© 2023
