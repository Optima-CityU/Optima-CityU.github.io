abstract: Building change detection (BCD) for very-high-spatial-resolution (VHR) remote
  sensing images is very important and challenging in the field of remote sensing,
  as the building is one of the most significant and valuable man-made ground targets.
  This article proposes a localâ€“global pyramid network (LGPNet) that combines a local
  feature pyramid module (LFPM) and a global spatial pyramid module (GSPM) for various
  building feature extraction. The LFPM is constructed using the convolutional kernel
  with three different pyramid scales, and then, the local pyramid features are obtained
  by adding features of each scale. In the GSPM, the global spatial pyramid features
  are extracted by adaptive average pooling to acquire global contextual information
  from different fields of view on deep features. The LFPM and the GSPM work in a
  parallel and complementary manner to capture discriminative features of various
  buildings. In addition to the LFPM and the GSPM, the proposed LGPNet also employs
  two general attention mechanisms, i.e., the position attention module and the channel
  attention module, which can select and emphasize adaptively some building features
  with high semantic responses. Besides, in order to mitigate the influence of other
  ground targets to a certain extent, a cross-task transfer learning strategy is introduced
  to make the LGPNet focus on the building, which significantly improves the performance
  of our method. Extensive experiments on two public available BCD datasets show that
  the proposed LGPNet can achieve significant improvement compared with eight other
  state-of-the-art methods. The source code and the pretrained model will be released
  at https://github.com/TongfeiLiu/LGPNet .
