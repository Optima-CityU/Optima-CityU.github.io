abstract: Population initialization is always needed in evolutionary multi-objective
  optimization (EMO) algorithms. Intuitively, a well-designed initialization method
  can help facilitate the evolutionary process and improve the performance of EMO
  algorithms. However, very few studies have investigated the effects of initialization
  methods on the performance of EMO algorithms. Many existing EMO algorithms randomly
  generate an initial population to start the evolutionary process. To fill this research
  gap and attract more attention from EMO researchers to this important yet under-explored
  issue, in this paper, we examine the effects of various initialization methods that
  may become promising alternatives to the commonly-used random initialization method.
  Each initialization method is evaluated through computational experiments on test
  problems of various sizes with 5-1000 decision variables. Experimental results clearly
  demonstrate the advantage of well-designed initialization methods over the random
  initialization method. This study provides useful insights into EMO algorithm design
  and motivates further research on population initialization. Â© 2023 IEEE.
