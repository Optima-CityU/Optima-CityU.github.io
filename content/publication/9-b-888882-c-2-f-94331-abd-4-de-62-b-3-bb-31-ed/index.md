abstract: The surrogate-assisted optimization algorithms (SAOAs) are very promising
  for solving computationally expensive optimization problems (EOPs). Generally, the
  performance of a SAOA is determined by the quality of its surrogate model and the
  infill sampling criterion. In this paper, we propose a radial basis function (RBF)
  assisted optimization algorithm with batch infill sampling criterion for solving
  EOPs (short for RBFBS). In RBFBS, the quality of RBF model is adjusted by choosing
  a good shape parameter via solving a sub-expensive hyperparameter optimization problem.
  Moreover, a batch infill sampling criterion that includes a bi-objective-based sampling
  approach and a single-objective-based sampling approach is proposed to get a batch
  of samples for expensive evaluation. The experimental results on various benchmark
  problems show that RBFBS is very promising for expensive optimization.
