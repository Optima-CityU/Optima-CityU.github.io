 abstract = {The surrogate-assisted optimization algorithms (SAOAs) are very promising for solving computationally expensive optimization problems (EOPs). Generally, the performance of a SAOA is determined by the quality of its surrogate model and the infill sampling criterion. In this paper, we propose a radial basis function (RBF) assisted optimization algorithm with batch infill sampling criterion for solving EOPs (short for RBFBS). In RBFBS, the quality of RBF model is adjusted by choosing a good shape parameter via solving a sub-expensive hyperparameter optimization problem. Moreover, a batch infill sampling criterion that includes a bi-objective-based sampling approach and a single-objective-based sampling approach is proposed to get a batch of samples for expensive evaluation. The experimental results on various benchmark problems show that RBFBS is very promising for expensive optimization.},
