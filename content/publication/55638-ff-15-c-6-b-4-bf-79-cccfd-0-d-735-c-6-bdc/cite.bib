 abstract = {This article investigates the properties of ratio and difference-based indicators under the Minkovsky distance and demonstrates that a ratio-based indicator with infinite norm is the best for solution evaluation among these indicators. Accordingly, a promising-region-based evolutionary many-objective algorithm with the ratio-based indicator is proposed. In our proposed algorithm, a promising region is identified in the objective space using the ratio-based indicator with infinite norm. Since the individuals outside the promising region are of poor quality, we can discard these solutions from the current population. To ensure the diversity of population, a strategy based on the parallel distance is introduced to select individuals in the promising region. In this strategy, all individuals in the promising region are projected vertically onto the normal plane so that crowded distances between them can be calculated. Afterward, two solutions with a smaller distance are selected from the candidate solutions each time, and the solution with the smaller indicator fitness value is removed from the current population. Empirical studies on various benchmark problems with 3-20 objectives show that the proposed algorithm performs competitively on all test problems. Compared with a number of other state-of-The-Art evolutionary algorithms, the proposed algorithm is more robust on these problems with various Pareto fronts.},
