abstract: Optimization problems with variable-length decision space are a class of
  challenging optimization problems derived from some real world applications, such
  as the composite laminate stacking problem and the sensor coverage problem. Unlike
  other optimization problems, the solutions in these problems might be represented
  as the vectors with different variable size (i.e., dimensionality). So far, some
  research efforts have been done on the use of evolutionary algorithms for solving
  single objective variable-length optimization problems. In fact, the variable-length
  problem difficulty can also exist in multiobjective optimization. However, such
  challenging problems have not yet gained much attention in the area of evolutionary
  multiobjective optimization. To facilitate the research on the variable-length Pareto
  optimization, we first suggest a systematic toolkit for constructing benchmark multiobjective
  test problems with variable-length feature in this paper. Then, we also propose
  a variable-length multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on a two-level decomposition
  strategy, which decomposes a multiobjective optimization problem in terms of the
  PBI search directions and the dimensionality of variables. The performance of our
  proposed algorithm and three other state-of-the-art algorithms on these problems
  are compared. To further show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, some
  experimental results on a bi-objective laminate stacking optimization problem are
  also reported and analyzed.
