 abstract = {Optimization problems with variable-length decision space are a class of challenging optimization problems derived from some real world applications, such as the composite laminate stacking problem and the sensor coverage problem. Unlike other optimization problems, the solutions in these problems might be represented as the vectors with different variable size (i.e., dimensionality). So far, some research efforts have been done on the use of evolutionary algorithms for solving single objective variable-length optimization problems. In fact, the variable-length problem difficulty can also exist in multiobjective optimization. However, such challenging problems have not yet gained much attention in the area of evolutionary multiobjective optimization. To facilitate the research on the variable-length Pareto optimization, we first suggest a systematic toolkit for constructing benchmark multiobjective test problems with variable-length feature in this paper. Then, we also propose a variable-length multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on a two-level decomposition strategy, which decomposes a multiobjective optimization problem in terms of the PBI search directions and the dimensionality of variables. The performance of our proposed algorithm and three other state-of-the-art algorithms on these problems are compared. To further show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, some experimental results on a bi-objective laminate stacking optimization problem are also reported and analyzed.},
