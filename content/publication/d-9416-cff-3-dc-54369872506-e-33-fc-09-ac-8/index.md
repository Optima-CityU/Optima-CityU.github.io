abstract: It is very difficult to locate multiple global optimal solutions (GOSs)
  of multimodal optimization problems (MMOPs). To deal with this issue, a penalty-based
  multimodal optimization differential evolution (DE), called PMODE, is developed
  in this article. In PMODE, a penalty strategy with a dynamic penalty radius is constructed
  to solve MMOPs. An elite selection mechanism is designed to identify and select
  elite solutions. The neighboring areas of these elite solutions are penalized. PMODE
  uses a popular DE variant--JADE as its search engine. The proposed PMODE is compared
  with several other state-of-the-art multimodal optimization algorithms on 20 MMOPs
  used in the IEEE CEC2013 special session. The experimental results show that PMODE
  performs better than other state-of-the-art methods.
