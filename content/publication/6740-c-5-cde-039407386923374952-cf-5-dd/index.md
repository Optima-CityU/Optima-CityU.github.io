abstract: In many real-world applications, the Pareto Set (PS) of a continuous multiobjective
  optimization problem can be a piecewise continuous manifold. A decision maker may
  want to find a solution set that approximates a small part of the PS and requires
  the solutions in this set share some similarities. This paper makes a first attempt
  to address this issue. We first develop a performance metric that considers both
  optimality and variable sharing. Then we design an algorithm for finding the model
  that minimizes the metric to meet the usertextquoterights requirements. Experimental
  results illustrate that we can obtain a linear model that approximates the mapping
  from the preference vectors to solutions in a local area well. Â© 2023, The Author(s),
