abstract: Decomposition based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms approximate the
  Pareto front of a multiobjective optimization problem by optimizing a set of subproblems
  in a collaborative manner. Often, each subproblem is associated with a direction
  vector and a reference point. The settings of these parameters have a very critical
  impact on convergence and diversity of the algorithm. Some work has been done to
  study how to set and adjust direction vectors to enhance algorithm performance for
  particular problems. In contrast, little effort has been made to study how to use
  reference points for controlling diversity in decomposition based algorithms. In
  this paper, we first study the impact of the reference point setting on selection
  in decomposition based algorithms. To balance the diversity and convergence, a new
  variant of the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition with
  both the ideal point and the nadir point is then proposed. This new variant also
  employs an improved global replacement strategy for performance enhancement. Comparison
  of our proposed algorithm with some other state-of-the-art algorithms is conducted
  on a set of multiobjective test problems. Experimental results show that our proposed
  algorithm is promising.
