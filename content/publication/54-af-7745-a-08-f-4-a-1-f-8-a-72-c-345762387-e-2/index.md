abstract: With the rise of globalization and environmental concerns, distributed scheduling
  and energy-efficient scheduling have become crucial topics in the informational
  manufacturing system. Additionally, the growing consideration about realistic constraints,
  such as transportation time and finite transportation resources, has made the scheduling
  problem increasingly complex. Facing these challenges, special mechanisms are required
  to improve the efficiency of solving algorithms. In this paper, a bi-learning evolutionary
  algorithm (BLEA) is proposed to solve the distributed energy-efficient flexible
  job shop problem with transportation constraints (DEFJSP-T). Firstly, we integrate
  statistical learning (SL) and evolutionary learning (EL) in the framework, while
  decomposition and Pareto dominance methods are employed in different stages to handle
  conflicting objectives. During the SL stage, probability models are established
  to statistically search for advantageous substructures on each weight vector, and
  an update mechanism is devised to improve the exploration. In the EL stage, the
  genetic operators are introduced and an improved local search that takes into account
  the problem properties is proposed to realize sufficient exploitation. Finally,
  according to the performance of the SL, a novel switching mechanism between SL and
  EL is designed to ensure the rational allocation of computing resources. Extensive
  experiments are conducted to test the performances of the BLEA. The statistical
  comparison shows that the BLEA is superior in solving the DEFJSP-T in terms of efficiency
  and effectiveness. Â© 2024 IEEE. Personal use is permitted, but republication/redistribution
