abstract: "Multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D),
  which bridges the traditional optimization techniques and population-based methods,
  has become an increasingly popular framework for evolutionary multiobjective optimization.
  It decomposes a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) into a number of optimization
  subproblems. Each subproblem is handled by an agent in a collaborative manner. The
  selection of MOEA/D is a process of choosing solutions by agents. In particular,
  each agent has two requirements on its selected solution: one is the convergence
  toward the efficient front, the other is the distinction with the other agents'
  choices. This paper suggests addressing these two requirements by defining mutual-preferences
  between subproblems and solutions. Afterwards, a simple yet effective method is
  proposed to build an interrelationship between subproblems and solutions, based
  on their mutual-preferences. At each generation, this interrelationship is used
  as a guideline to select the elite solutions to survive as the next parents. By
  considering the mutual-preferences between subproblems and solutions (i.e., the
  two requirements of each agent), the selection operator is able to balance the convergence
  and diversity of the search process. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on
  several MOP test instances with complicated Pareto sets. Empirical results demonstrate
  the effectiveness and competitiveness of our proposed algorithm."
