abstract: Distributed storage systems like the Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS)
  constitute the core infrastructure of cloud platforms which are well poised to deal
  with big-data. An optimised HDFS is critical for effective data management in terms
  of reduced file service time and access latency, improved file availability and
  system load balancing. Recognising that the file-replication strategy is key to
  an optimised HDFS, this paper focuses on the file-replica placement strategy while
  simultaneously considering storage and network load. Firstly, the conflicting relationship
  between storage and network load is analysed and a bi-objective optimisation model
  is built, following which a multi-objective optimisation memetic algorithm based
  on decomposition (MOMAD) and its improved version are used. Compared to the default
  strategy in HDFS, the file-replica placement strategies based on multi-objective
  optimisation provide more diverse solutions. And competitive performance could be
  obtained by the proposed algorithm.
