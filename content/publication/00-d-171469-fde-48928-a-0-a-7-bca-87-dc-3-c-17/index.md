abstract: Many practical multiobjective optimization problems have a nested bilevel
  structure in variables, which can be modeled as bilevel multiobjective optimization
  problems (BLMOPs). In this paper, a cooperative coevolution with knowledge-based
  variable decomposition, called BLMOCC, is proposed for BLMOPs. In BLMOCC, the variable
  interactions are represented by an interaction matrix. The perturbation-based variable
  decomposition combined with the matrix completion approach has been designed for
  dynamically discovering the correlation among the bilevel variables, based on which
  the variables are divided into different groups. To further handle possible weak
  correlations among various groups of variables, a cooperative coevolution has been
  adopted for optimizing them in a collaborative way. In experimental studies, BLMOCC
  is compared with a nested method (NS) and a state-of-the-art algorithm (H-BLEMO)
  on a set of benchmark problems. The effects of each component in BLMOCC have also
  been verified by comparing it with its three variants. The experimental results
  demonstrate that BLMOCC has the best performance among all the compared algorithms.
  In addition, BLMOCC has also been applied to a real-world management decision making
  problem, which further validates its efficiency and effectiveness.
