abstract: Pareto local search (PLS) is a basic building block in many metaheuristics
  for a multiobjective combinatorial optimization problem. In this paper, an enhanced
  PLS variant called parallel PLS based on decomposition (PPLS/D) is proposed. PPLS/D
  improves the efficiency of PLS using the techniques of parallel computation and
  problem decomposition. It decomposes the original search space into L subregions
  and executes L parallel processes searching in these subregions simultaneously.
  Inside each subregion, the PPLS/D process is guided by a unique scalar objective
  function. PPLS/D differs from the well-known two phase PLS in that it uses the scalar
  objective function to guide every move of the PLS procedure in a fine-grained manner.
  In the experimental studies, PPLS/D is compared against the basic PLS and a recently
  proposed PLS variant on the multiobjective unconstrained binary quadratic programming
  problems and the multiobjective traveling salesman problems with, at most, four
  objectives. The experimental results show that regardless of whether the initial
  solutions are randomly generated or generated by heuristic methods, PPLS/D always
  performs significantly better than the other two PLS variants.
