 abstract = {Decomposition-based algorithms have become increasingly popular for evolutionary multiobjective optimization. However, the effect of scalarizing methods used in these algorithms is still far from being well understood. This paper analyzes a family of frequently used scalarizing methods, the Lp methods, and shows that the p value is crucial to balance the selective pressure toward the Pareto optimal and the algorithm robustness to Pareto optimal front (PF) geometries. It demonstrates that an Lp method that can maximize the search ability of a decomposition-based algorithm exists and guarantees that, given some weight, any solution along the PF can be found. Moreover, a simple yet effective method called Pareto adaptive scalarizing (PaS) approximation is proposed to approximate the optimal p value. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of PaS, we incorporate PaS into a state-of-the-art decomposition-based algorithm, i.e., multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D), and compare the resultant MOEA/D-PaS with some other MOEA/D variants on a set of problems with different PF geometries and up to seven conflicting objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that the PaS is effective.},
