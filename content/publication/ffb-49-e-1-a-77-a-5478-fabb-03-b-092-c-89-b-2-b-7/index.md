abstract: Currently, evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithms have
  been successfully used to find a good approximation of many-objective optimization
  problems (MaOPs). To measure the performance of EMO algorithms, many benchmark multiobjective
  test problems have been constructed. Among them, DTLZ and WFG are two representative
  test suites with the scalability to the number of variables and objectives. It should
  be pointed out that MaOPs can be more challenging if they are involved with difficult
  problem features, such as objective scalability, complicated Pareto set, bias, disconnection,
  or degeneracy. In this paper, a set of ten new test problems with above-mentioned
  difficulties are constructed. Some experimental results on these test problems found
  by two popular EMO algorithms, i.e., MOEA/D and NSGA-III, are reported and analyzed.
  Moreover, the performance of these two EMO algorithms with different population
  sizes on these test problems are also studied.
