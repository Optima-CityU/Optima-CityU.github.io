abstract: Evolution strategies are a class of evolutionary algorithms for black-box
  optimization and achieve state-of-the-art performance on many benchmarks and real-world
  applications. Evolution strategies typically evolve a Gaussian distribution to approach
  the optimum. In this paper, we present a survey of recent advances in evolution
  strategies. We summarize the techniques, extensions, and practical considerations
  of evolution strategies for various optimization problems. We discuss some important
  open questions and promising topics that desire further research. Many of the discussed
  techniques and principles are applicable to other algorithms.
