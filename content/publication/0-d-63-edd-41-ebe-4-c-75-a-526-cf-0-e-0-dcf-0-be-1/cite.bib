 abstract = {Facility layout problems (FLPs) in hospitals are typically to arrange facilities or rooms along both sides of a corridor to minimize some objectives. In a hospital, very often there are center-islands to decrease the flow cost among facilities or rooms. However, these islands have not been considered before. In this article, we propose an FLP with center-islands that involves two parallel rows and center-islands. A mixed-integer program formulation is established for modeling it. A methodology for combining a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) and linear program is proposed to solve this problem. MOEA/D optimizes the sequence of facilities on two rows and center-islands while the linear program is embedded into MOEA/D to optimize the exact locations of center-islands. A tabu search with a local search is also integrated into MOEA/D to enhance its search capability. Experiments show that our proposed methodology can effectively solve the problem.},
