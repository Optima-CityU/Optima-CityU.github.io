abstract: Facility layout problems (FLPs) in hospitals are typically to arrange facilities
  or rooms along both sides of a corridor to minimize some objectives. In a hospital,
  very often there are center-islands to decrease the flow cost among facilities or
  rooms. However, these islands have not been considered before. In this article,
  we propose an FLP with center-islands that involves two parallel rows and center-islands.
  A mixed-integer program formulation is established for modeling it. A methodology
  for combining a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D)
  and linear program is proposed to solve this problem. MOEA/D optimizes the sequence
  of facilities on two rows and center-islands while the linear program is embedded
  into MOEA/D to optimize the exact locations of center-islands. A tabu search with
  a local search is also integrated into MOEA/D to enhance its search capability.
  Experiments show that our proposed methodology can effectively solve the problem.
