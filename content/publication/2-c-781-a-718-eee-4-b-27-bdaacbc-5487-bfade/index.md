abstract: Multi-objectivization is a term used to describe strategies developed for
  optimizing single-objective problems by multi-objective algorithms. This paper focuses
  on multi-objectivizing the sum-of-the-parts combinatorial optimization problems,
  which include the traveling salesman problem, the unconstrained binary quadratic
  programming and other well-known combinatorial optimization problem. For a sum-of-the-parts
  combinatorial optimization problem, we propose to decompose its original objective
  into two sub-objectives with controllable correlation. Based on the decomposition
  method, two new multi-objectivization inspired single-objective optimization techniques
  called non-dominance search and non-dominance exploitation are developed, respectively.
  Non-dominance search is combined with two metaheuristics, namely iterated local
  search and iterated tabu search, while non-dominance exploitation is embedded within
  the iterated Linâ€“Kernighan metaheuristic. The resultant metaheuristics are called
  ILS+NDS, ITS+NDS and ILK+NDE, respectively. Empirical studies on some TSP and UBQP
  instances show that with appropriate correlation between the sub-objectives, there
  are more chances to escape from local optima when new starting solution is selected
  from the non-dominated solutions defined by the decomposed sub-objectives. Experimental
  results also show that ILS+NDS, ITS+NDS and ILK+NDE all significantly outperform
  their counterparts on most of the test instances.
