abstract: Meta-heuristic algorithms search the problem solution space to obtain a
  satisfactory solution within a reasonable timeframe. By combining domain knowledge
  of the specific optimization problem, the search efficiency and quality of meta-heuristic
  algorithms can be significantly improved, making it crucial to identify and summarize
  domain knowledge within the problem. In this paper, we summarize and analyze domain
  knowledge that can be applied to meta-heuristic algorithms in the job-shop scheduling
  problem (JSP). Firstly, this paper delves into the importance of domain knowledge
  in optimization algorithm design. After that, the development of different methods
  for the JSP are reviewed, and the domain knowledge in it for meta-heuristic algorithms
  is summarized and classified. Applications of this domain knowledge are analyzed,
  showing it is indispensable in ensuring the optimization performance of meta-heuristic
  algorithms. Finally, this paper analyzes the relationship among domain knowledge,
  optimization problems, and optimization algorithms, and points out the shortcomings
  of the existing research and puts forward research prospects. This paper comprehensively
  summarizes the domain knowledge in the JSP, and discusses the relationship between
  the optimization problems, optimization algorithms and domain knowledge, which provides
  a research direction for the meta-heuristic algorithm design for solving the JSP
  in the future. Â© The author(s) 2024.
