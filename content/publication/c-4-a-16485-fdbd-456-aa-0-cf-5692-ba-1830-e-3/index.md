abstract: Online promotion helps enhance brand awareness and boost sales. Although
  it attracts customer traffic, an ill-conceived price promotion has serious repercussions
  because it disproportionately draws bargain hunters, results in profit erosion and
  causes operational chaos due to erratic demands. This research proposes a long-term
  optimization model to help dual channel (click-and-mortar) retailers understand
  the conditions necessary to promote products online across all markets. When partial
  markets are recommended, we investigate how to price and select the market portfolio
  for promotion in each time period. We develop a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm
  to efficiently solve complex and large-scale problems. Both theoretical analysis
  and numerical study show that the proposed model outperforms the conventional strategy
  of promoting online across the board. Due to its dynamic nature, the multi-period
  recurring promotion problem is difficult to address optimally. Our model is capable
  of planning for multiple periods, multiple markets, and multiple objectives to maximize
  long term profitability and competitiveness. Click-and-mortar retailers will find
  our approach extremely effective for maximizing profit, enhancing brand awareness,
  and improving customer satisfaction.
