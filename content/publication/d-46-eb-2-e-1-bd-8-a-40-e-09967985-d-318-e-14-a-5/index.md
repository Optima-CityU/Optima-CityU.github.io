abstract: The objective reduction has been regarded as a basic issue in many-objective
  optimization. Existing objective reduction methods identify one set of essential
  objectives using an approximate nondominated front. However, if the Pareto front
  (PF) of a many-objective optimization problem (MaOP) is irregular, one single set
  of essential objectives may not be efficient for objective reduction. This article
  proposes to produce several different sets of essential objectives in objective
  reduction. More specifically, we use the Gaussian mixture model clustering to classify
  the obtained nondominated front into different subsets and perform objective reduction
  on each subset. Both an offline objective reduction method and an online objective
  reduction method are developed. The experimental results indicate that our proposed
  methods work well for MaOPs with degenerate or nondegenerate PFs. Â© 2022 IEEE.
