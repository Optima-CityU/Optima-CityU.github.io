abstract: Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms based on decomposition (MOEA/D) decompose
  a multiobjective optimization problem into a set of simple optimization subproblems
  and solve them in a collaborative manner. A replacement scheme, which assigns a
  new solution to a subproblem, plays a key role in balancing diversity and convergence
  in MOEA/D. This paper proposes a global replacement scheme which assigns a new solution
  to its most suitable subproblems. We demonstrate that the replacement neighborhood
  size is critical for population diversity and convergence, and develop an approach
  for adjusting this size dynamically. A steady-state algorithm and a generational
  one with this approach have been designed and experimentally studied. The experimental
  results on a number of test problems have shown that the proposed algorithms have
  some advantages.
