 abstract = {Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms based on decomposition (MOEA/D) decompose a multiobjective optimization problem into a set of simple optimization subproblems and solve them in a collaborative manner. A replacement scheme, which assigns a new solution to a subproblem, plays a key role in balancing diversity and convergence in MOEA/D. This paper proposes a global replacement scheme which assigns a new solution to its most suitable subproblems. We demonstrate that the replacement neighborhood size is critical for population diversity and convergence, and develop an approach for adjusting this size dynamically. A steady-state algorithm and a generational one with this approach have been designed and experimentally studied. The experimental results on a number of test problems have shown that the proposed algorithms have some advantages.},
