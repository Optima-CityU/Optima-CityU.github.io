abstract: 'This article proposes a three-level radial basis function (TLRBF)-assisted
  optimization algorithm for expensive optimization. It consists of three search procedures
  at each iteration: 1) the global exploration search is to find a solution by optimizing
  a global RBF approximation function subject to a distance constraint in the whole
  search space; 2) the subregion search is to generate a solution by minimizing an
  RBF approximation function in a subregion determined by fuzzy clustering; and 3)
  the local exploitation search is to generate a solution by solving a local RBF approximation
  model in the neighborhood of the current best solution. Compared with some other
  state-of-the-art algorithms on five commonly used scalable benchmark problems, ten
  CEC2015 computationally expensive problems, and a real-world airfoil design optimization
  problem, our proposed algorithm performs well for expensive optimization.'
