abstract: The team orienteering problem with time windows (TOPTW) is a well studied
  routing problem. In this paper, a cooperative algorithm is proposed. It collaborates
  metaheuristic and branch-and-price. A restricted master problem and subproblem are
  defined. It uses a heuristic to obtain an integral solution for the restricted master
  problem and a metaheuristic to generate new columns for the subproblem. Experimental
  study shows that this algorithm can find new better solutions for several instances
  in short time, which supports the effectiveness of the cooperative mechanism between
  metaheuristic and branch-and-price.
