abstract: Multi-task learning uses knowledge transfer among tasks to improve the generalization
  performance of all tasks. For deep multi-task learning, knowledge transfer is often
  implemented via sharing all hidden features of tasks. A major shortcoming is that
  it can lead to negative knowledge transfer across tasks when task correlation is
  weak. To overcome it, this paper proposes an evolutionary method to learn sparse
  sharing representations adaptively. By embedding the neural network optimization
  into evolutionary multitasking, our proposed method finds an optimal combination
  of tasks and sharing features. It can identify negative correlation and redundant
  features and then remove them from the hidden feature set. Thus, an optimal sparse
  sharing subnetwork can be produced for each task. Experiment results show that the
  proposed method achieve better learning performance with a smaller inference model
  than other related methods. Â© 2023 IEEE.
