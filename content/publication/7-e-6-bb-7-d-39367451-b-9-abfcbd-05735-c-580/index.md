abstract: This paper proposes an idea of using heuristic local search procedures specific
  for single-objective optimisation in multiobjectie evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs).
  In this paper, a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D)
  hybridised with a multi-start single-objective metaheuristic called greedy randomised
  adaptive search procedure (GRASP). In our method a multiobjetive optimisation problem
  (MOP) is decomposed into a number of single-objecive subproblems and optimised in
  parallel by using neighbourhood information. The proposed GRASP alternates between
  subproblems to help them escape local Pareto optimal solutions. Experimental results
  have demonstrated that MOEA/D with GRASP outperforms the classical MOEA/D algorithm
  on the multiobjective 0-1 knapsack problem that is commonly used in the literature.
  It has also demonstrated that the use of greedy genetic crossover can significantly
  improve the algorithm performance.
