 abstract = {This paper proposes an idea of using heuristic local search procedures specific for single-objective optimisation in multiobjectie evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). In this paper, a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) hybridised with a multi-start single-objective metaheuristic called greedy randomised adaptive search procedure (GRASP). In our method a multiobjetive optimisation problem (MOP) is decomposed into a number of single-objecive subproblems and optimised in parallel by using neighbourhood information. The proposed GRASP alternates between subproblems to help them escape local Pareto optimal solutions. Experimental results have demonstrated that MOEA/D with GRASP outperforms the classical MOEA/D algorithm on the multiobjective 0-1 knapsack problem that is commonly used in the literature. It has also demonstrated that the use of greedy genetic crossover can significantly improve the algorithm performance.},
