abstract: This paper reports our experiences of applying process algebras and associated
  tools (esp. CSP/FDR2) to verify asynchronous circuit designs developed in the Balsa
  environment. Balsa is an asynchronous logic synthesis system which uses syntax-directed
  compilation to generate gate-level implementations from high-level descriptions
  in a parallel programming language (also called Balsa). Previously, we have proposed
  a unifying approach to compositionally verifying Balsa designs across several abstraction
  levels. This paper continues our effort by applying and testing our approach on
  several large-scale real-life case studies. We describe the outcome of verification
  for the case studies, and also analyse the strengths and limitations of our method.
