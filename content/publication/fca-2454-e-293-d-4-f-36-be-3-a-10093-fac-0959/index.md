abstract: Achieving balance between convergence and diversity is a basic issue in
  evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO). In this paper, we propose a hybrid
  EMO algorithm that assigns different selection principles to two separate and co-evolving
  archives. Particularly, one archive maintains a repository with a competitive selection
  pressure towards the Pareto-optimal front (PF), the other preserves a population
  with a satisfied distribution in the objective space. Furthermore, to exploit guidance
  information towards the Pareto-optimal set (PS), we develop a restricted mating
  selection mechanism to select mating parents from each archive for offspring generation.
  Empirical studies are conducted on a set of benchmark problems with complicated
  PSs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of our
  proposed algorithm in balancing convergence and diversity.
