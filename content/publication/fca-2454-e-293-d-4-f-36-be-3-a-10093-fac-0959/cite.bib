 abstract = {Achieving balance between convergence and diversity is a basic issue in evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO). In this paper, we propose a hybrid EMO algorithm that assigns different selection principles to two separate and co-evolving archives. Particularly, one archive maintains a repository with a competitive selection pressure towards the Pareto-optimal front (PF), the other preserves a population with a satisfied distribution in the objective space. Furthermore, to exploit guidance information towards the Pareto-optimal set (PS), we develop a restricted mating selection mechanism to select mating parents from each archive for offspring generation. Empirical studies are conducted on a set of benchmark problems with complicated PSs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of our proposed algorithm in balancing convergence and diversity.},
