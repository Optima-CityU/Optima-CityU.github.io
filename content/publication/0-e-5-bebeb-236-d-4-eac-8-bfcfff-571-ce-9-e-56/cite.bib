 abstract = {In this paper, we show that the techniques widely used in multi-objective optimization can help a single-objective local search procedure escape from local optima and find better solutions. The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is selected as a case study. Firstly the original TSP ƒ0 is decomposed into two TSPs ƒ1 and ƒ2 such that ƒ0 = ƒ1 + ƒ2 . Then we propose the Non-Dominance Search (NDS) method which applies the non-domination concept on (ƒ1 , ƒ2 to guide a local search out of the local optima of ƒ0 . In the experimental study, NDS is combined with Iterated Local Search (ILS), a well-known metaheuristic for the TSP. Experimental results on some selected TSPLIB instances show that the proposed NDS can significantly improve the performance of ILS.},
