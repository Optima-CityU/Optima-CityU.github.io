abstract: Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) can find a set of Pareto
  solutions to the multi-objective optimization problem. However, it is still a challenge
  for the decision-maker to understand the relationship between various Pareto solutions
  and pick up the really preferred solution. This article proposes an objective extraction
  method to simplify the many-objective solution set by reducing the objective dimensionality
  but keeping the dominance and distribution relationships between solutions. First,
  a sparse regularized self-representation (SRSR) model is developed to learn the
  linear relationship among objectives, in which all objectives are determined by
  a set of base ones. Second, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)
  is constructed to solve such a model. Finally, an objective extraction method (SRSR-OE)
  that can preserve the dominance and distribution relationships between solutions
  is invented by exploiting the learned relationship. Experimental results show that
  our SRSR model and ADMM algorithm are efficient for extracting the linear objective
  relationship, and the developed objective extraction method also has advantages
  over some state-of-the-art ones in preserving dominance and distribution relationships
  between solutions after solution set simplification. Â© 2023 IEEE.
