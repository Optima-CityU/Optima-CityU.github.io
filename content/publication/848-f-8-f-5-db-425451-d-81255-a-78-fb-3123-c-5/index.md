abstract: In Multiobjective Optimization problems the objective functions may have
  different scales, which leads to a neglecting of one or more objective functions.
  The most common-used way in the literature to solve this drawback is to normalize
  the objective space; however, a set of uniformly distributed solutions in the normalized
  objective space may not be uniformly distributed in the original objective space
  with more than two objective functions. In this work, we present an improved version
  of the Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) which
  incorporates a new aggregation technique based on the Normal Boundary Intersection
  approach and the Tchebycheff approach (MOEA/D-NBI) for solving 3-objective optimization
  problems with different scales of objectives.
