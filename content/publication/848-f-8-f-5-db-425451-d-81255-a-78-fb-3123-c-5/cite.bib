 abstract = {In Multiobjective Optimization problems the objective functions may have different scales, which leads to a neglecting of one or more objective functions. The most common-used way in the literature to solve this drawback is to normalize the objective space; however, a set of uniformly distributed solutions in the normalized objective space may not be uniformly distributed in the original objective space with more than two objective functions. In this work, we present an improved version of the Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) which incorporates a new aggregation technique based on the Normal Boundary Intersection approach and the Tchebycheff approach (MOEA/D-NBI) for solving 3-objective optimization problems with different scales of objectives.},
