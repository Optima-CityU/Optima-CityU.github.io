abstract: The covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) is one of the
  most successful evolutionary algorithms. CMA-ES incrementally learns the variable
  metric by evolving a full covariance matrix. Yet, it suffers from high computational
  overload. In this paper, we propose two efficient variants of CMA-ES, termed mutation
  matrix adaptation (MMA-ES) and exponential MMA-ES (xMMA-ES). These variants are
  derived by taking the first order approximation of the update of the covariance
  matrix in CMA-ES. Both variants avoid the computational costly matrix decomposition
  while keeping the simplicity of the update scheme of CMA-ES. We analyze the properties
  and connections of MMA-ES and xMMA-ES to other variants of evolution strategies.
  We have experimentally studied the proposed algorithmstextquoteright behaviors and
  performances. xMMA-ES and MMA-ES generally outperform or perform competitively to
  CMA-ES. We have investigated the performance of MMA-ES with the BiPop restart strategy
  on the BBOB benchmarks. The experimental results validate the performance of the
  proposed algorithms.
