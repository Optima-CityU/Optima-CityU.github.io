abstract: Domination-based sorting and decomposition are two basic strategies used
  in multiobjective evolutionary optimization. This paper proposes a hybrid multiobjective
  evolutionary algorithm integrating these two different strategies for combinatorial
  optimization problems with two or three objectives. The proposed algorithm works
  with an internal (working) population and an external archive. It uses a decomposition-based
  strategy for evolving its working population and uses a domination-based sorting
  for maintaining the external archive. Information extracted from the external archive
  is used to decide which search regions should be searched at each generation. In
  such a way, the domination-based sorting and the decomposition strategy can complement
  each other. In our experimental studies, the proposed algorithm is compared with
  a domination-based approach, a decomposition-based one, and one of its enhanced
  variants on two well-known multiobjective combinatorial optimization problems. Experimental
  results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms other approaches. The effects
  of the external archive in the proposed algorithm are also investigated and discussed.
