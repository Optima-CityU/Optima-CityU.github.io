abstract: The implicit parallelism of a population in evolutionary algorithms (EAs)
  provides an ideal platform for dealing with multiple tasks simultaneously. However,
  little effort has been made to explore what information among different tasks can
  be used as valuable knowledge to help the optimization of different tasks. This
  paper proposes a multiobjective multitask optimization evolutionary algorithm based
  on decomposition with dual neighborhoods (MTEA/D-DN), in which the neighborhood
  is used as a bridge to achieve knowledge transfer among different tasks. In MTEA/D-DN,
  each subproblem not only maintains a neighborhood (internal neighborhood) within
  its own task based on the Euclidean distance between weight vectors, but also keeps
  a neighborhood (external neighborhood) with the subproblems of other tasks via grey
  relation analysis in order to mine valuable information and communicate among tasks.
  Experimental studies show that our proposed algorithm outperforms five other state-of-the-art
  algorithms on a set of benchmark test instances and a real-world problem in steel
  plant. Â© 2022 IEEE.
