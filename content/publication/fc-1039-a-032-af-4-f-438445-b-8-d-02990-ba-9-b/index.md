abstract: Pareto Local Search (PLS) is an extension of local search to multiobjective
  combinatorial optimization problems (MCOPs). It is widely used as a building block
  in many multiobjective metaheuristics. However, it suffers from poor anytime behavior
  and long convergence time. In this paper, we focus on improving the neighborhood
  exploration mechanism to accelerate PLS. In total, we propose three new search strategies,
  namely, Promising List, Don't Look Bits and Continuing Search and implement them
  on the multiobjective Traveling Salesman Problem (mTSP) and the multiobjective Unconstrained
  Binary Quadratic Programming (mUBQP) problem. In Promising List, features of problem
  structure are utilized to guide the local search. In Don't Look Bits, neighborhood
  moves that are less promising to produce improving solutions are skipped. In Continuing
  Search, the agent will start from where previous neighborhood exploration stops
  to avoid repetitive neighborhood moves. The experimental results verify the effectiveness
  of the three techniques both individually and collaboratively on most of the test
  instances. Besides, one proposed PLS variant outperforms two state-of-the-art PLS-based
  algorithms. Â© 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
