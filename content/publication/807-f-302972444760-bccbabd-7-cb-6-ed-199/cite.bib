 abstract = {Decomposition-based many-objective evolutionary algorithms generally decompose the objective space into multiple subregions with the help of a set of reference vectors. The resulting subregions are fixed since the reference vectors are usually pre-defined. When the optimization problem has a complicated Pareto front, this decomposition may decrease the algorithm performance. To deal with this problem, this paper proposes a dynamical decomposition strategy. Instead of using pre-defined reference vectors, solution themselves are used as reference vectors. Thus, they are adapted to the shape of Pareto front automatically. Besides, the subregions are produced one by one through successively bipartitioning the objective space. The resulting subregions are not fixed but dynamically determined by the population solutions as well as the subregions produced previously. Based on this strategy, a solution ranking method, named DDR, is proposed which can be employed in the mating selection and environmental selection in commonly used algorithm frameworks. Compared with those in the other decomposition-based algorithms, DDR has the following properties: (1) no pre-defined reference vectors are required; (2) less parameters are involved and (3) the ranking results can not only be utilized directly to select solutions but also serve as a secondary criterion in traditional Pareto-based algorithms. In this paper, DDR is equipped in two algorithm frameworks for handling many-objective optimization problems. Comparisons with five state-of-the-art algorithms on 31 widely used test problems are carried out to test the performance of the proposed approach. The experimental results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed approach in keeping a good trade-off between convergence and diversity.},
