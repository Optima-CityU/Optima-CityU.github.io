abstract: MOEA/D is a decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm that
  has attracted much attention in recent years. Its performance depends on the setting
  of weight vectors which are used for defining subproblems. In the case of irregular
  Pareto fronts (e.g, disconnected or degenerated), fixed setting of weight vectors
  in MOEA/D may not work well. In this paper, we propose an improved MOEA/D with both
  random and fixed weight vectors. Moreover, an external archive based on a modified
  Ïµ-dominance strategy is used for storing nondominated solutions found by the proposed
  algorithm and assisting the generation of random weight vectors. Some experiments
  have been conducted to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the improved MOEA/D
  on benchmark multiobjective test problems with irregular Pareto fronts. The experimental
  results show that the overall performance of the proposed algorithm is better than
  baseline MOEA/D and NSGA-II.
