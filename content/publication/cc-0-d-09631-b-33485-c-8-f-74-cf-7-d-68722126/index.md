abstract: Uniform sampling in the permutation space is very important for solving
  permutation problems with NP-hard nature. However, due to the complexity of this
  space, there is no uniform sampling method for it up to now. In this paper, the
  description of permutation space and a review of uniform sampling in other space
  are given. After that, the limitation of the random method for uniform sampling
  is analyzed, and a k-means clustering algorithm with an improved Borda's method
  is introduced for sampling based on the above analysis. An extended Latin matrix
  is defined, and a sampling method based on this matrix that can only solve for a
  fixed number of sampling is presented. The properties of this method are explored
  and demonstrated. A uniform sampling method is then proposed for an arbitrary number
  of sampling points. Experiments are implemented under different sizes of permutation
  spaces and the results show that the method proposed in this paper has superior
  performance, which is more than 100 times better than the random method. © The Author(s),
