abstract: Expensive multi-objective optimization problems can be found in many real-world
  applications, where their objective function evaluations involve expensive computations
  or physical experiments. It is desirable to obtain an approximate Pareto front with
  a limited evaluation budget. Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) has been
  widely used for finding a finite set of Pareto optimal solutions. However, it is
  well-known that the whole Pareto set is on a continuous manifold and can contain
  infinite solutions. The structural properties of the Pareto set are not well exploited
  in existing MOBO methods, and the finite-set approximation may not contain the most
  preferred solution(s) for decision-makers. This paper develops a novel learning-based
  method to approximate the whole Pareto set for MOBO, which generalizes the decomposition-based
  multi-objective optimization algorithm (MOEA/D) from finite populations to models.
  We design a simple and powerful acquisition search method based on the learned Pareto
  set, which naturally supports batch evaluation. In addition, with our proposed model,
  decision-makers can readily explore any trade-off area in the approximate Pareto
  set for flexible decision-making. This work represents the first attempt to model
  the Pareto set for expensive multi-objective optimization. Experimental results
  on different synthetic and real-world problems demonstrate the effectiveness of
  our proposed method. Â© 2022 Neural Information Processing Systems Foundation. All
