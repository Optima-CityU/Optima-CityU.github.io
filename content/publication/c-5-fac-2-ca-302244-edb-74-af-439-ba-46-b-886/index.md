abstract: Homotopy optimization is a traditional method to deal with a complicated
  optimization problem by solving a sequence of easy-to-hard surrogate subproblems.
  However, this method can be very sensitive to the continuation schedule design and
  might lead to a suboptimal solution to the original problem. In addition, the intermediate
  solutions, often ignored by classic homotopy optimization, could be useful for many
  real-world applications. In this work, we propose a novel model-based approach to
  learn the whole continuation path for homotopy optimization, which contains infinite
  intermediate solutions for any surrogate subproblems. Rather than the classic unidirectional
  easy-to-hard optimization, our method can simultaneously optimize the original problem
  and all surrogate subproblems in a collaborative manner. The proposed model also
  supports the real-time generation of any intermediate solution, which could be desirable
  for many applications. Experimental studies on different problems show that our
  proposed method can significantly improve the performance of homotopy optimization
  and provide extra helpful information to support better decision-making.Â© 2023 by
