abstract: Achieving balance between convergence and diversity is a key issue in evolutionary
  multiobjective optimization. Most existing methodologies, which have demonstrated
  their niche on various practical problems involving two and three objectives, face
  significant challenges in many-objective optimization. This paper suggests a unified
  paradigm, which combines dominance- and decomposition-based approaches, for many-objective
  optimization. Our major purpose is to exploit the merits of both dominance- and
  decomposition-based approaches to balance the convergence and diversity of the evolutionary
  process. The performance of our proposed method is validated and compared with four
  state-of-The-art algorithms on a number of unconstrained benchmark problems with
  up to 15 objectives. Empirical results fully demonstrate the superiority of our
  proposed method on all considered test instances. In addition, we extend this method
  to solve constrained problems having a large number of objectives. Compared to two
  other recently proposed constrained optimizers, our proposed method shows highly
  competitive performance on all the constrained optimization problems.
