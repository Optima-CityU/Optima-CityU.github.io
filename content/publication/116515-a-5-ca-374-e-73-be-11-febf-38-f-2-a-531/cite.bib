 abstract = {Combining machine learning techniques has shown great potentials in evolutionary optimization since the domain knowledge of an optimization problem, if well learned, can be a great help for creating high-quality solutions. However, existing learning-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms spend too much computational overhead on learning. To address this problem, we propose a learning-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm where an online learning algorithm is embedded within the evolutionary search procedure. The online learning algorithm takes the stream of sequentially generated solutions along the evolution as its training data. It is noted that the stream of solutions are temporal, dependent, non-stationary and non-static. These data characteristics make existing online learning algorithm not suitable for the evolution data. We hence modify an existing online agglomerative clustering algorithm to accommodate these characteristics. The modified online clustering algorithm is applied to adaptively discover the structure of the Pareto optimal set; and the learned structure is used to guide new solution creation. Experimental results have shown significant improvement over four state-of-the-art multiobjective evolutionary algorithms on a variety of benchmark problems.},
