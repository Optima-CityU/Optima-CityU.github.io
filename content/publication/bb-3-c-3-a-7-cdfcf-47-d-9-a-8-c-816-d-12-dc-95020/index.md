abstract: "Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) based Multi-objective Evolutionary
  Algorithms (MOEAs) are increasingly becoming popular for dealing with optimization
  problems with more than three objectives, commonly termed as many-objective optimization
  problems (MaOPs). These algorithms elicit preferences from a single or multiple
  Decision Makers (DMs), a priori or interactively, to guide the search towards the
  solutions most preferred by the DM(s), as against the whole Pareto-optimal Front
  (POF). Despite its promise for dealing with MaOPs, the utility of this approach
  is impaired by the lack of-objectivity; repeatability; consistency; and coherence
  in DM's preferences. This paper proposes a machine learning based framework to counter
  the above limitations. Towards it, the preference-structure of the different objectives
  embedded in the problem model is learnt in terms of: a smallest set of conflicting
  objectives which can generate the same POF as the original problem; the smallest
  objective sets corresponding to pre-specified errors; and the objective sets of
  pre-specified sizes that correspond to minimum error. While the focus is on demonstrating
  how the proposed framework could serve as a decision support for the DM, its performance
  is also studied vis-a-vis an alternative approach (based on dominance relation preservation),
  for a wide range of test problems and a real-world problem. The results mark a new
  direction for MCDM based MOEAs for MaOPs. "
