 abstract = {Pareto local search (PLS) is a natural extension of local search for multiobjective combinatorial optimization problems (MCOPs). In our previous work, we improved the anytime performance of PLS using parallel computing techniques and proposed a parallel PLS based on decomposition (PPLS/D). In PPLS/D, the solution space is searched by multiple independent parallel processes simultaneously. This article further improves PPLS/D by introducing two new cooperative process techniques, namely, a cooperative search mechanism and a cooperative subregion-adjusting strategy. In the cooperative search mechanism, the parallel processes share high-quality solutions with each other during the search according to a distributed topology. In the proposed subregion-adjusting strategy, a master process collects useful information from all processes during the search to approximate the Pareto front (PF) and redivide the subregions evenly. In the experimental studies, three well-known NP-hard MCOPs with up to six objectives were selected as test problems. The experimental results on the Tianhe-2 supercomputer verified the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.},
