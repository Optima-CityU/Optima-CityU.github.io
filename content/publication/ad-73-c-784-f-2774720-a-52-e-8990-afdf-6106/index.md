abstract: 'The pure accuracy measure is used to eliminate random consistency from
  the accuracy measure. Biases to both majority and minority classes in the pure accuracy
  are lower than that in the accuracy measure. In this paper, we demonstrate that
  compared with the accuracy measure and F-measure, the pure accuracy measure is class
  distribution insensitive and discriminative for good classifiers. The advantages
  make the pure accuracy measure suitable for traditional classification. Further,
  we mainly focus on two points: exploring a tighter generalization bound on pure
  accuracy based learning paradigm and designing a learning algorithm based on the
  pure accuracy measure. Particularly, with the self-bounding property, we build an
  algorithm-independent generalization bound on the pure accuracy measure, which is
  tighter than the existing bound of an order O (1/√N) (N is the number of instances).
  The proposed bound is free from making a smoothness or convex assumption on the
  hypothesis functions. In addition, we design a learning algorithm optimizing the
  pure accuracy measure and use it in the selective ensemble learning setting. The
  experiments on sixteen benchmark data sets and four image data sets demonstrate
  that the proposed method statistically performs better than the other eight representative
  benchmark algorithms. © 2022 IEEE.'
