abstract: The tradeoff between exploration and exploitation is critical to the performance
  of an evolutionary algorithm. Different levels of exploration-exploitation tradeoff
  are required at different evolutionary stages for achieving a satisfactory performance
  of an evolutionary algorithm. In this paper, we propose a novel survival analysis
  method to intelligently guide the maintenance of the exploration-exploitation tradeoff
  in multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. The survival analysis stems from a deep
  understanding of the evolutionary search procedure. Through survival analysis, an
  indicator is derived, which is used to guide the adoption of appropriate recombination
  operators, based on the assumption that the roles of these operators in terms of
  their capabilities on exploration-exploitation can be asserted. In the developed
  algorithm, a differential evolution recombination operator and a new sampling strategy
  are hybridized. Empirical comparison with five well-known multiobjective evolutionary
  algorithms on a number of test instances with complex Pareto sets and Pareto fronts
  indicates the effectiveness and superiority of the developed algorithm in terms
  of commonly-used performance metrics on these test instances.
