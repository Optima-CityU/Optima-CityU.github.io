 abstract = {The tradeoff between exploration and exploitation is critical to the performance of an evolutionary algorithm. Different levels of exploration-exploitation tradeoff are required at different evolutionary stages for achieving a satisfactory performance of an evolutionary algorithm. In this paper, we propose a novel survival analysis method to intelligently guide the maintenance of the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. The survival analysis stems from a deep understanding of the evolutionary search procedure. Through survival analysis, an indicator is derived, which is used to guide the adoption of appropriate recombination operators, based on the assumption that the roles of these operators in terms of their capabilities on exploration-exploitation can be asserted. In the developed algorithm, a differential evolution recombination operator and a new sampling strategy are hybridized. Empirical comparison with five well-known multiobjective evolutionary algorithms on a number of test instances with complex Pareto sets and Pareto fronts indicates the effectiveness and superiority of the developed algorithm in terms of commonly-used performance metrics on these test instances.},
