abstract: Most current data is multivariable, exploring and identifying valuable information
  in these datasets has far-reaching impacts. In particular, discovering meaningful
  hidden association patterns in multivariate plays an important role. Plenty of measures
  for multivariate association have been proposed, yet it is still an open research
  challenge for effectively capturing association patterns among three or more variables,
  especially the scenario without any prior knowledge about those relationships. To
  do so, we desire a distribution-free, association type-independent and non-parametrical
  measure. For practical applications, such a measure should comparable, interpretable,
  scalable, intuitive, reliability, and robust. However, no exiting measures fulfill
  all of these desiderata. In this paper, taking advantage of the neighborhood information
  of a sample, we propose MNA, a maximal neighborhood multivariate association measure
  that satisfies all the above criteria. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real
  data show it outperforms state-of-the-art multivariate association measures. Â© 2022
