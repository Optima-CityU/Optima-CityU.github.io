abstract: This paper investigates how to use a pre-selection approach to improve the
  performance of the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition
  (MOEA/D). It proposes a novel MOEA/D algorithm with classification to serve this
  purpose. The proposed algorithm builds a classification model on the search space
  to filter all new generated solutions, and mainly evaluates those promising solutions
  for reducing real function evaluation costs during the search process. Experimental
  study on different test instances validates that the pre-selection approach can
  significantly improve the performance of a classical MOEA/D.
