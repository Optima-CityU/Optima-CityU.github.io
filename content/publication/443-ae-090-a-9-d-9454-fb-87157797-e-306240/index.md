abstract: Regularity models have been used in dealing with noise-free multiobjective
  optimization problems. This paper studies the behavior of a regularity model in
  noisy environments and argues that it is very suitable for noisy multiobjective
  optimization. We propose to embed the regularity model in an existing multiobjective
  evolutionary algorithm for tackling noises. The proposed algorithm works well in
  terms of both convergence and diversity. In our experimental studies, we have compared
  several state-of-the-art of algorithms with our proposed algorithm on benchmark
  problems with different levels of noises. The experimental results showed the effectiveness
  of the regularity model on noisy problems, but a degenerated performance on some
  noisy-free problems.
