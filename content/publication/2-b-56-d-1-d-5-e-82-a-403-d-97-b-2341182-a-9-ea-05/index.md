abstract: Surrogate model assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have recently attracted
  much attention due to the growing need for computationally expensive optimization
  in many real-world applications. Most current SAEAs, however, focus on small-scale
  problems. SAEAs for medium-scale problems (i.e., 20-50 decision variables) have
  not yet been well studied. In this paper, a Gaussian process surrogate model assisted
  evolutionary algorithm for medium-scale computationally expensive optimization problems
  (GPEME) is proposed and investigated. Its major components are a surrogate model-aware
  search mechanism for expensive optimization problems when a high-quality surrogate
  model is difficult to build and dimension reduction techniques for tackling the
  'curse of dimensionality.' A new framework is developed and used in GPEME, which
  carefully coordinates the surrogate modeling and the evolutionary search, so that
  the search can focus on a small promising area and is supported by the constructed
  surrogate model. Sammon mapping is introduced to transform the decision variables
  from tens of dimensions to a few dimensions, in order to take advantage of Gaussian
  process surrogate modeling in a low-dimensional space. Empirical studies on benchmark
  problems with 20, 30, and 50 variables and a real-world power amplifier design automation
  problem with 17 variables show the high efficiency and effectiveness of GPEME. Compared
  to three state-of-the-art SAEAs, better or similar solutions can be obtained with
  12% to 50% exact function evaluations. Â© 1997-2012 IEEE.
