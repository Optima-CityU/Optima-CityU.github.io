abstract: A multimodal multiobjective optimization problem can have multiple equivalent
  Pareto Sets (PSs). Since the number of PSs may vary in different problems, if the
  population is restricted to a fixed size, the number of solutions found for each
  PS will inevitably fluctuate widely, which is undesirable for decision makers. To
  address the issue, this paper proposes a clustering-assisted adaptive evolutionary
  algorithm based on decomposition (CA-MMEA/D), whose search process can be roughly
  divided into two stages. In the first stage, an initial exploration of decision
  space is carried out, and then solutions with good convergence are used for clustering
  to estimate the number and location of multiple PSs. In the second stage, new search
  strategies are developed on the basis of clustering, which can take advantage of
  unimodal search methods. Experimental studies show that the proposed algorithm outperforms
  some state-of-the-art algorithms, and CA-MMEA/D can keep the number of solutions
  found for each PS at a relatively stable level for different problems, thus making
  it easier for decision makers to choose the desired solutions. The research in this
  paper provides new ideas for the design of decomposition-based multimodal multiobjective
  algorithms. Â© 2024 Elsevier B.V.
