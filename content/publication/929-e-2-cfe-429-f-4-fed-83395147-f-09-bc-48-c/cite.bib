 abstract = {The decomposition-based algorithms [e.g., multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D)] transform a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) into a number of single-objective optimization subproblems and solve them in a collaborative manner. It is a natural framework for using single-objective local search (LS) to solve combinatorial MOPs. However, commonly used decomposition methods, such as weighted sum (WS), Tchebycheff (TCH), and penalty-based boundary intersection (PBI) may not be good at maintaining the population diversity while providing diverse initial solutions for different LS procedures in a collaborative way. Based on our previous work on the constrained decomposition with grids (CDG), this article proposes a dynamic CDG (DCDG) framework used to design a multiobjective memetic algorithm (DCDG-MOMA). DCDG uses grids for maintaining diversity, supporting the collaborative LS. In addition, DCDG dynamically increases the number of grids for obtaining more nondominated solutions as well as the better collaborative search among them. DCDG-MOMA has been compared with several classical and state-of-the-art algorithms on multiobjective traveling salesman problem (MOTSP), multiobjective quadratic assignment problem (MOQAP), and multiobjective capacitated arc routing problem (MOCARP).},
