abstract: This paper explores the problem of recovering the discriminative representation
  of a hyperspectral remote sensing image (HRSI), which suffers from spectral variations,
  to boost its classification accuracy. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new
  method, namely local-global balanced low-rank approximation (GLB-LRA), which can
  increase the similarity between pixels belonging to an identical category while
  promoting the discriminability between pixels of different categories. Specifically,
  by taking advantage of the particular structural spatial information of HRSIs, we
  exploit the low-rankness of an HRSI robustly in both spatial and spectral domains
  from the perspective of local and global balance. We mathematically formulate GLB-LRA
  as an explicit optimization problem and propose an iterative algorithm to solve
  it efficiently. Experimental results over three commonly-used benchmark datasets
  demonstrate the significant superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.
