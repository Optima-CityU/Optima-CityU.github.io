abstract: Decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) decompose
  a multiobjective optimization problem into a set of scalar objective subproblems
  and solve them in a collaborative way. A na√Øve way to distribute computational effort
  is to treat all the subproblems equally and assign the same computational resource
  to each subproblem. This paper proposes a generalized resource allocation (GRA)
  strategy for decomposition-based MOEAs by using a probability of improvement vector.
  Each subproblem is chosen to invest according to this vector. An offline measurement
  and an online measurement of the subproblem hardness are used to maintain and update
  this vector. Utility functions are proposed and studied for implementing a reasonable
  and stable online resource allocation strategy. Extensive experimental studies on
  the proposed GRA strategy have been conducted.
