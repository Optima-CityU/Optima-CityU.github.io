abstract: Under mild conditions, the Pareto front (Pareto set) of a continuous m-objective
  optimization problem forms an (m-1)-dimensional piecewise continuous manifold. Based
  on this property, this paper proposes a self-organizing multiobjective evolutionary
  algorithm. At each generation, a self-organizing mapping method with (m-1) latent
  variables is applied to establish the neighborhood relationship among current solutions.
  A solution is only allowed to mate with its neighboring solutions to generate a
  new solution. To reduce the computational overhead, the self-organizing training
  step and the evolution step are conducted in an alternative manner. In other words,
  the self-organizing training is performed only one single step at each generation.
  The proposed algorithm has been applied to a number of test instances and compared
  with some state-of-the-art multiobjective evolutionary methods. The results have
  demonstrated its advantages over other approaches.
