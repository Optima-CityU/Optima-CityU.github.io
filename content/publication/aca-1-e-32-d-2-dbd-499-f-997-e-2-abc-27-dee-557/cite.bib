 abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to multiobjective algorithms aimed at modeling the Pareto set using neural networks. Whereas previous methods mainly focused on identifying a finite number of solutions, our approach allows for the direct modeling of the entire Pareto set. Furthermore, we establish an equivalence between learning the complete Pareto set and maximizing the associated hypervolume, which enables the convergence analysis of hypervolume (as a new metric) for Pareto set learning. Specifically, our new analysis framework reveals the connection between the learned Pareto solution and its representation in a polar coordinate system. We evaluate our proposed approach on various benchmark problems and real-world problems, and the encouraging results make it a potentially viable alternative to existing multiobjective algorithms.
