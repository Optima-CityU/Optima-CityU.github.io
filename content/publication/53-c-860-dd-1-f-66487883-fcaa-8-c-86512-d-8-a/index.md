abstract: A decomposition approach decomposes a multiobjective optimization problem
  into a number of scalar objective optimization subproblems. It plays a key role
  in decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. However, many widely
  used decomposition approaches, originally proposed for mathematical programming
  algorithms, may not be very suitable for evolutionary algorithms. To help decomposition-based
  multiobjective evolutionary algorithms balance the population diversity and convergence
  in an appropriate manner, this letter proposes to impose some constraints on the
  subproblems. Experiments have been conducted to demonstrate that our proposed constrained
  decomposition approach works well on most test instances. We further propose a strategy
  for adaptively adjusting constraints by using information collected from the search.
  Experimental results show that it can significantly improve the algorithm performance.
