abstract: Stable matching-based selection models the selection process in MOEA/D as
  a stable marriage problem. By finding a stable matching between the sub problems
  and solutions, the solutions are assigned to sub problems to balance the convergence
  and the diversity. In this paper, a two-level stable matching-based selection is
  proposed to further guarantee the diversity of the population. More specifically,
  the first level of stable matching only matches a solution to one of its most preferred
  sub problems and the second level of stable matching is responsible for matching
  the solutions to the remaining sub problems. Experimental studies demonstrate that
  the proposed selection scheme is effective and competitive comparing to other state-of-The-Art
  selection schemes for MOEA/D.
