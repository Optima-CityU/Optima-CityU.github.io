abstract: Compositionality facilitates the comprehension of novel objects using acquired
  concepts and the maintenance of a knowledge pool. This is particularly crucial for
  continual learners to prevent catastrophic forgetting and enable compositionally
  forward transfer of knowledge. However, the existing state-of-the-art benchmarks
  inadequately evaluate the capability of compositional generalization, leaving an
  intriguing question unanswered. To comprehensively assess this capability, we introduce
  two vision benchmarks, namely Compositional GQA (CGQA) and Compositional OBJects365
  (COBJ), along with a novel evaluation framework called Compositional Few-Shot Testing
  (CFST). These benchmarks evaluate the systematicity, productivity, and substitutivity
  aspects of compositional generalization. Experimental results on five baselines
  and two modularity-based methods demonstrate that current continual learning techniques
  do exhibit somewhat favorable compositionality in their learned feature extractors.
  Nonetheless, further efforts are required in developing modularity-based approaches
  to enhance compositional generalization. We anticipate that our proposed benchmarks
  and evaluation protocol will foster research on continual learning and compositionality.
