abstract: The design of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) should find the
  optimal phase shift matrix and the optimal phase shift values. By encoding the RIS
  phase shifts and the phase shift values into a design matrix, a new RIS design scheme
  with multi-objective optimization using multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA)/D-RIS
  is proposed. The scheme can search for the optimal RIS phase matrix and the optimal
  phase shift values in the meantime. For a multiuser RIS-assisted multiple-input–single-output
  (MISO) system, binary phase shifts of values of 5° and 166°, other than 0° and 180°,
  will yield better RIS performance. © 2024 IEEE.
