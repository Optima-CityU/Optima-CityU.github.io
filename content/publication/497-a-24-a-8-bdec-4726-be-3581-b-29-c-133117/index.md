abstract: A two-phase evolutionary algorithm is developed to find multiple solutions
  of a nonlinear equations system. It transforms a nonlinear equations system into
  a multimodal optimization problem. In phase one of the proposed algorithm, a strategy
  combines a multiobjective optimization technique and a niching technique to maintain
  the population diversity. Phase two consists of a detection method and a local search
  method for encouraging the convergence. The detection method finds several promising
  subregions and the local search method locates the corresponding optimal solutions
  in each promising subregion. The experiments on a set of 30 nonlinear equation systems
  demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is better than other state-of-the-art algorithms.
