abstract: We have recently proposed a framework of in vivo computation (IVC) which
  transforms the early tumor sensing problem into a computational problem. In the
  framework, a tumor-triggered biological gradient field (BGF) guides the swarm-intelligence-assisted
  targeting process, where externally manipulable and trackable magnetic nanorobots
  act as computational agents for the optimization procedure. As BGF can be viewed
  as an objective function which is utilized to define the fitness landscape for the
  agents, the inherent attributes of BGF are critical to the IVC process. All our
  previous investigations are based on the hypothesis that the BGF landscape remains
  time invariant during the tumor-targeting process, which results in a static function
  optimization problem. However, the properties of internal environment, such as the
  flow state of body fluid, will naturally lead to time-dependent variation of BGF,
  which means that the targeting process should be modeled as a dynamic function optimization
  problem. Based on this consideration, we focus on dynamic IVC by considering different
  variation patterns of BGF in this article. Two computational intelligence strategies
  named “swarm-based learning” and “individual-based learning” are proposed for dealing
  with the turbulence of the fitness estimation caused by the BGF variation. The in
  silico experiments and statistical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
  proposed strategies. In addition, the above process is conducted in a 3-D search
  space, where the tumor vascular network is generated by an invasion percolation
  algorithm, which is more realistic compared to the 2-D search space in our previous
  works. © 2022 IEEE.
