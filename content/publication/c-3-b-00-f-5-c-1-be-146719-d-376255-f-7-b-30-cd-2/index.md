abstract: Bilevel metaheuristics have been widely used for bilevel optimization. However,
  recent studies have indicated that most bilevel metaheuristics are inefficient since
  they perform the lower-level optimization task for each upper-level solution independently
  and neglect the relationship among lower-level optimization tasks. In this paper,
  we develop a bilevel metaheuristic with the collaborations among lower-level optimization
  tasks. Specifically, a population is evolved to solve the lower-level optimization
  tasks for all upper-level solutions collaboratively at each generation. In the population,
  each solution is associated with a lower-level optimization task. In such a way,
  all lower-level optimization tasks can be solved in a single run. To capture the
  individual features of different lower-level optimization tasks, we construct a
  lower-level search distribution for each lower-level optimization task based on
  all solutions in the population. In addition, an information-sharing mechanism is
  proposed to share good solutions among lower-level optimization tasks. Experiments
  on two sets of test problems and three practical applications demonstrate that our
  proposed algorithm performs better than other bilevel metaheuristics in comparison.
