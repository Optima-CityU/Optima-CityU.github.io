abstract: This letter suggests an approach for decomposing a multiobjective optimization
  problem (MOP) into a set of simple multiobjective optimization subproblems. Using
  this approach, it proposes MOEA/D-M2M, a new version of multiobjective optimization
  evolutionary algorithm-based decomposition. This proposed algorithm solves these
  subproblems in a collaborative way. Each subproblem has its own population and receives
  computational effort at each generation. In such a way, population diversity can
  be maintained, which is critical for solving some MOPs. Experimental studies have
  been conducted to compare MOEA/D-M2M with classic MOEA/D and NSGA-II. This letter
  argues that population diversity is more important than convergence in multiobjective
  evolutionary algorithms for dealing with some MOPs. It also explains why MOEA/D-M2M
  performs better. Â© 2013 IEEE.
