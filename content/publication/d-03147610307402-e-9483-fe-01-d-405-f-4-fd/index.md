abstract: The construction of promising solutions for NscriptP-hard combinatorial
  optimization problems (COPs) in meta-heuristics is usually based on three types
  of information, namely a priori information, a posteriori information learned from
  visited solutions during the search procedure, and online information collected
  in the solution construction process. Prior information reflects our domain knowledge
  about the COPs. Extensive domain knowledge can surely make the search effective,
  yet it is not always available. Posterior information could guide the meta-heuristics
  to globally explore promising search areas, but it lacks local guidance capability.
  On the contrary, online information can capture local structures, and its application
  can help exploit the search space. In this paper, we studied the effects of using
  this information on meta-heuristic's algorithmic performances for the COPs. The
  study was illustrated by a set of heuristic algorithms developed for the quadratic
  assignment problem. We first proposed an improved scheme to extract online local
  information, then developed a unified framework under which all types of information
  can be combined readily. Finally, we studied the benefits of the three types of
  information to meta-heuristics. Conclusions were drawn from the comprehensive study,
  which can be used as principles to guide the design of effective meta-heuristic
  in the future. Â© 2013 IEEE.
