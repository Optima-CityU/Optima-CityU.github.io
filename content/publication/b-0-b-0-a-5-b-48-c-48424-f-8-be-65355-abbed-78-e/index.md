abstract: This letter proposes a new optimization technique for wiggly parallel-coupled
  line (PCL) structure design. Compared with other existing wiggly PCL design approach,
  our proposed technique does not require complicated math formula derivation and
  is able to consider several performance indexes simultaneously. We use our technique
  to design a compact ultra-wideband (UWB) microstrip bandpass filter (BPF) at 3.1-10.6
  GHz for achieving low passband insertion loss and good linearity, and satisfying
  out-of-band rejection. This filter can be used in indoor and hand-held UWB systems.
