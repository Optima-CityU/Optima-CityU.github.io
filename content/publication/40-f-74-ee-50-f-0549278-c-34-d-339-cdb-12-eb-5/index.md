abstract: This paper proposes a multiobjective multidepot vehicle routing problem
  with time windows and designs some real-world test instances. It develops a two-stage
  multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (TS-MOEA) for dealing with the problem. Stage
  I of our proposed algorithm focuses on finding extreme solutions, and forms a coarse
  Pareto front, while stage II extends the found extreme solutions for approximating
  the whole Pareto front. The two-stage strategy provides a new method to balance
  convergence and diversity. Moreover, a hybrid neighborhood structure is designed
  for solution improvement. Experimental result shows that TS-MOEA significantly outperforms
  two other representative algorithms.
