abstract: Batch-processing machines (BPMs) can process a number of jobs at a time,
  which can be found in many industrial systems. This article considers a single BPM
  scheduling problem with unequal release times and job sizes. The goal is to assign
  jobs into batches without breaking the machine capacity constraint and then sort
  the batches to minimize the makespan. A self-adaptive differential evolution algorithm
  is developed for addressing the problem. In our proposed algorithm, mutation operators
  are adaptively chosen based on their historical performances. Also, control parameter
  values are adaptively determined based on their historical performances. Our proposed
  algorithm is compared to CPLEX, existing metaheuristics for this problem and conventional
  differential evolution algorithms through comprehensive experiments. The experimental
  results demonstrate that our proposed self-adaptive algorithm is more effective
  than other algorithms for this scheduling problem.
