abstract: The hypervolume contribution is widely used in indicator-based multiobjective
  algorithms. We propose an algorithm to compute exact 4-D hypervolume contributions
  for a set of n points in O(n3⁄2 log n) time. Our algorithm improves the currently
  best time complexity O(n2) by O(√n⁄log n), and it is the first algorithm of subquadratic
  time for this problem. Our algorithm is built upon a space partition method in computational
  geometry and a geometric structure called the anchored gradient. We also propose
  a new space partition strategy to reduce the practical running time and the space
  overhead of this algorithm. Experimental results on a variety of test instances
  show that our proposed algorithm performs better than the existing state-of-the-art
  algorithm especially on point sets with cliff or other irregular properties. © 2023
