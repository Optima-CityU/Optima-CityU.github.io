abstract: The first cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm (CCEA) was proposed by Potter
  and De Jong in 1994 and since then many CCEAs have been proposed and successfully
  applied to solving various complex optimization problems. In applying CCEAs, the
  complex optimization problem is decomposed into multiple subproblems, and each subproblem
  is solved with a separate subpopulation, evolved by an individual evolutionary algorithm
  (EA). Through cooperative co-evolution of multiple EA subpopulations, a complete
  problem solution is acquired by assembling the representative members from each
  subpopulation. The underlying divide-and-conquer and collaboration mechanisms enable
  CCEAs to tackle complex optimization problems efficiently, and hence CCEAs have
  been attracting wide attention in the EA community. This paper presents a comprehensive
  survey of these CCEAs, covering problem decomposition, collaborator selection, individual
  fitness evaluation, subproblem resource allocation, implementations, benchmark test
  problems, control parameters, theoretical analyses, and applications. The unsolved
  challenges and potential directions for their solutions are discussed.
