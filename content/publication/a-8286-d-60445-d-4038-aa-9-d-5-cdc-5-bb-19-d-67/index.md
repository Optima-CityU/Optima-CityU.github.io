abstract: Base station antenna usually requires dual polarization operation with satisfactory
  input return loss, adequate dual-polarization isolation, stable gain and half-power
  beamwidth in a wide bandwidth covering the entire or part of the mobile communication
  bands. Such comprehensive requirements provoke great challenges in antenna design.
  A novel design scheme is proposed by involving fragment-type structures (FTS) in
  antenna, and seeking for the optimal FTS by multi-objective optimization searching.
  The technique is demonstrated by improving crossed dipoles for operation in band
  ranging from 1.7 GHz to 3.8 GHz. Part of the dipole arms can be gridded into cells
  and re-configured by using FTS elements. For automatic optimization searching, binary
  coding scheme for both the FTS distributions and canonical dipole structure dimensions
  is proposed. Simulation and measurement show that the optimal crossed dipole antenna
  may acquire a wide operation bandwidth of 76.3%, with the return loss higher than
  15 dB, isolation higher than 30 dB, half-power beamwidth of 65° ± 5°, and gain of
  9 ± 0.65 dBi for ±45° polarizations.
